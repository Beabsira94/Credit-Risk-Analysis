# Credit Scoring Model Project

## Business Need

As an Analytics Engineer at Bati Bank, a leading financial service provider, I am tasked with developing a Credit Scoring Model. Bati Bank is partnering with a successful eCommerce company to enable a buy-now-pay-later service, allowing customers to purchase products on credit if they qualify.

Credit scoring assesses a potential borrower's likelihood of defaulting on a loan. The model will evaluate potential borrowers by analyzing data provided by the eCommerce platform.

## Project Objectives
- Define a proxy variable to categorize users as high risk (bad) or low risk (good).
- Select observable features that are strong predictors of default.
- Develop a model to assign risk probability for new customers.
- Assign credit scores based on risk probability estimates.
- Predict the optimal amount and duration of the loan.

## Completed Tasks

### Task 1 - Understanding Credit Risk
- Focus on comprehending the concept of Credit Risk.

### Task 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Overview of the Data:** Analyzed the structure, including rows, columns, and data types.
- **Summary Statistics:** Examined the central tendency and dispersion of the dataset.
- **Distribution of Numerical Features:** Visualized numerical features to identify patterns and outliers.
- **Distribution of Categorical Features:** Analyzed categorical feature distributions for frequency insights.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Studied relationships between numerical features.
- **Identifying Missing Values:** Detected missing data and evaluated imputation strategies.
- **Outlier Detection:** Utilized box plots to identify outliers.

## Next Steps
- **Task 3 - Feature Engineering:** Create and extract relevant features, encode categorical variables, handle missing values, and normalize/standardize numerical features.
- **Task 4 - Modeling:** Model selection and training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation of model performance.
- **Task 5 - Model Serving API Call:** Develop a REST API for real-time predictions.
